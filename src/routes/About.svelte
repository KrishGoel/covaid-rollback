        <p>
            With the recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases in Delhi and the NCR, a plethora of sources for information on availability of CoVid resources have started circulating. CovAID is a platform which facilitates smooth and accurate dispersal of information on the availability of beds, medicines, injections, etc. 
            <br/><br/>
            We will be making this possible by <strong>personally contacting hospitals and other organisations multiple times a day</strong> so as to <strong>update information in real-time as well as verify sources</strong>. This will help in eliminating outdated/false reports on availability. 
            <br/><br/>
            Alongside this, we have also be <strong>created a filter for conveniently searching Twitter updates regarding COVID-19 resources</strong> and availability. The nation has lost many lives due to inaccurate information dispersal. With our initiative, we hope to overcome this hurdle. 
            <br/><br/>
